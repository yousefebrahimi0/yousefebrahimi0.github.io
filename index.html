          <p>
The person who turns spreadsheets into revenue. Here's what I actually do: I'm the bridge between "we have data" and "now we know what to do with it." I sit at the rare intersection of Advanced Analytics and Digital Growth. While most professionals either bury themselves in code or float in marketing theory, I build the technical pipelines to mine insights (Python) and executing the strategies that turn those insights into traffic and revenue (Technical SEO/CRO).
Recent Impact: Leading SEO and growth analytics at Nova SBE, I improved organic traffic by 67% through technical optimization and achieved 39% increase in lead generation via data-driven CRM strategies. And, managed 9 premium SEO projects generating 60,000 monthly impressions and $180K in additional client revenue through strategic optimization.
</p>
<p>
The Numbers That Matter
→ 270% organic traffic increase through technical SEO at Nova SBE
→ $180K additional revenue for clients via strategic optimization
→ 45% lead generation boost using data-driven CRM automation
→ 50% reduction in manual processes through Python automation
</p>
<p>
Recent Impact: Across 9+ years at companies like Cisco, Nest Seekers, and Nova SBE, and other companies I’ve used data to drive quantifiable business outcomes: Revenue Impact: Uncovered $14.2M in upsell opportunities through predictive modeling and behavioral pattern recognition. Organic Growth: Engineered SEO strategies that drove a 400% traffic increase and secured Rank #1 for 12+ competitive "money keywords." Automation: Reduced manual reporting time by 50% by architecting robust ETL pipelines and automating CRM workflows.
</p>
<p>
My Approach: I treat business problems like a crime scene and data like the evidence. I use Python & SQL to find the clues, Tableau/Power BI to visualize the timeline, and A/B Testing to close the case. Now leveraging LLMs & AI to speed up code optimization and content scaling.

                    <p>I had the pleasure of working closely with Yousef during his time at Concentrix and I cannot recommend him highly enough. Despite the recent downsizing that led to his departure, Yousef consistently demonstrated a remarkable positive attitude and unwavering professionalism.</p>
                    <p>He has not only been an invaluable collaborator but also a source of support for his colleagues. His willingness to lend a helping hand, share his expertise, and contribute to team success made a significant impact on our workplace culture. His collaborative spirit and eagerness to assist others did not go unnoticed, and his contributions were greatly appreciated by all.</p>
                    <p>While we are saddened to see him go, I have no doubt that Yousef will excel in his future endeavors. I wholeheartedly recommend him for any role he chooses to pursue. His positive attitude, collaborative nature, and client-focused approach will undoubtedly make him a valuable asset to any team.</p>
                    <p>I wish him all the best in his career and am confident that he will continue to achieve great success.</p>

                    <p>The main topic was the development of an online platform (www.brainbox.center), where we can promote and offer our digital workshops and seminars. Yousef's "digital abilities" and his profound know how in concept and implementation are simply great.</p>
                    <p>He is always focussed on finding the best solution and he able to develop and implement the given task in time. Yousef is a very friendly and empathic individual with strong personal traits.</p>
                    <p>His passion and excitement are contagious. I can imagine, that he is a valuable member in any team. Please feel free, if you want to know more about my working experience with Yousef.</p>

                    <p>I had the pleasure of working with Yousef, during my time at Concentrix, I couldn't be more thankful for the time we have worked together.</p>
                    <p>Yousef has a unique set of skills, which I believe any company should value:</p>                    
                    <p>Not only is he thorough in the work he does, he moves past what's expect from him, he delivers with quality, not only has an analytical thinking which help me and our team to navigate some roadblocks, because the program we're both part of was recent and we didn't had all the answers in the beginning and we had overcome them ourselves, most importantly (this is the trait, I value and identify the most), Yousef is a team player and instead of looking for some kind of self-recognition, Yousef looks what is best for his team and helps others level-up.</p>
                    <p>Wish you all the best success in your future endeavors.</p>

                  <p>Yousef is one of my dearest friends. I had the chance to work with him for 2 years and I must say that he was a very well-organized and punctual colleague. His main quality was that he knew how to make quick decisions in difficult times and he was always a calm person with a lot of confidence in every activity that he took place in. Furthermore we were schoolmates as well and in terms of classmates I have to say that he was a very loyal friend with a good heart. I wish him nothing but success in his future professional career.                  </p>
